For simplicity, let's also assume that each quarter (3 months) is divided into two weeks' worth of vacation time for half the employees. This means that during any given week, approximately 25 employees might be on vacation.\n\nTo make it concrete:\n- If there are 4 quarters in a year, and each employee gets 10 days (two weeks) off per quarter, then each employee will take vacations over 4 different times throughout the year.\n- In one week, if we consider any random employee's schedule, they would be on vacation roughly \\( \\frac{25}{100} = 25\\% \\) of the time.\n\nLet’s use Python to simulate this and verify:\n\n```python\n# Total number of employees\ntotal_employees = 100\n\n# Number of employees on vacation in one week\nemployees_on_vacation_per_week = total_employees * 0.25\n\nprint(employees_on_vacation_per_week)\n```\n```output\n25.0\n```\nBased on the calculation, there are approximately \\(\\boxed{25}\\) staff members who are currently on vacation or absent at the time of the story.\n\nThis result assumes that each employee gets two weeks (10 days) off per quarter over four quarters in a year, and thus 25% of employees are on vacation during any given week. The number might vary slightly based on exact vacation scheduling, but this gives us an accurate estimate for a typical setup.",
