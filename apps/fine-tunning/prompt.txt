For reference, the context is: {{global_context}}

Given the following document summary:
{{doc_summary}}

…and this chunk of text from that document:
{{chunk_text}}

**Task**  
1. Generate as many question/eval-criteria/answer triples as needed to fully cover the information **in this chunk only** (do not invent facts).  
2. Each question must include enough context so it still makes sense if read in isolation.  
3. Return your work as valid JSON with this schema:  
   {
     "question": "...",
     "evaluation_criteria": ["bullet 1", "bullet 2", "..."],
     "answer": "...",
     "category": "fact | reasoning",
     "difficulty": "easy | medium | hard"
   }

**One worked example**

```json
{
  "question": "In touch rugby, how long is the field of play (in metres)?",
  "evaluation_criteria": ["answer gives a single number", "value is 70 ± 0.5 m"],
  "answer": "70 metres",
  "category": "fact",
  "difficulty": "easy"
}
